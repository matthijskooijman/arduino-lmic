**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is. _If you're not sure it's a bug, please file a Support Request instead._ A bug is a problem in the code, where you do something that the documentation says should work, but doesn't; _and_ you have reason to believe it's not working due to a defect in the code.

Wireless is tricky; if in doubt, start with a support request, rather than a bug report.
